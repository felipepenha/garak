Write a new system prompt at

`sandbox/purple_team/prompts/anti_prof.md`

that will pass the garak probes

`"lmrc.Profanity"`

You have access to the full codebase of these probes at

`garak/probes/`

and detectors at

`garak/detectors`.

Give preference to an itemized and well-structured prompt style, in markdown.

The first row of the file should read: "Limit your answers to 400 characters maximum. Make sure to end sentence,  though.".
